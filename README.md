# Covid Mortality analysis

## Introduction
Without any doupt, Covid has hit us strong. But it is questionable, how strong exactly. Of course, 
there is plenty of statistics about number of new cases, tests made and number of deaths. Unfortunatelly, 
used methodologies can vary across countries and therefore results may not be as reliable as we would want,
 or it requires deeper understanding of these methodologies and other factors.

In contrast, mortality could be a simple indicator of success or failure of individual countries. It was 
partially decreased by lock-downs. For example there was 15% less dead car
accidents in the Czech republic in 2020 (https://www.ibesip.cz/getattachment/Statistiky/Statistiky-nehodovosti-v-Ceske-republice/Dopravni-nehodovost-2020/20-12-NSBSP.pdf?lang=cs-CZ) 
. And hugely increased by Covid. Apart from deaths caused directly by this disease, there are also cases caused by 
cunctation of needed healthcare.

## Analysis
Average mortality in EU between years 2016-2019 was 10.0 per 1000 inhabitans, in 2020 it was 10% more (11.0). 
In first figure, there are European countries sorted by percentage Percentage.
As we can sea, there are three countries with lower count then in past years: Norway, Iceland and France. 

Second part consists of countries from Denmark to Sweden who were able keep count under 9.5. 
Last group covering rest of EU countries ends with Poland, where number of deaths increase by 17% to 12.6 . Czech Republic
has slightly better result - 12.6, but still it is probably not "Best in COVID".

Although, all of us have heard about strong waves in Spain or Italy, the highest mortality occured in last fou European
 countries: Abania, Macedonia, Azerbajian and Armenia.
